# Comp410-JUnit

JUnit test for Comp 410 Sp2017 Assignments

### Requires:

Java

### Usage with Eclipse

*For people with any Unix system, or Windows-Bash-Git shell*

Clone the repo using the download link (execute the following command in a
terminal prompt, assuming you have git):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/benknoble/Comp410-JUnit.git $SOME_LOCATION
```

The value of `SOME_LOCATION` should just be the directory where you want to keep
the repo.

Next, drag and drop the test case you want onto the appropriate Eclipse
project/package, and select *link file* when it asks how you want to add it.
This allows you to leave the file in the git-versioned repo and have it sync
with Eclipse.

Finally, periodically you should run the following command inside the directory
where you store the repo to pull in updates:

```bash
$ git pull
```

*Windows Users*: There's a desktop client you can use to achieve something
similar. Don't ask me about it.
